Since its introduction at LAK 2025, the framework has expanded rapidly: it now supports multiple model types—first-order Markov models, frequency-based transition models, co-occurrence.\n\nThis is the companion tutorial to the [main TNA tutorial](../tna-tutorial/index.html), focusing on **pairwise model comparison** using the `compare()` function. We assume you have already worked through the main tutorial and understand the basics of building a TNA model.\n\nA single TNA model describes one set of transition dynamics. But most research questions involve *two* models --- high vs. low achievers, pre vs. post intervention, treatment vs. control. Visual inspection can suggest differences, but cannot tell you whether a 3% weight gap is meaningful or which of two nearly-equal edges is actually stronger. `compare()` quantifies what changed, by how much, and where, so that you can report precise differences rather than eyeball them.\n\nThis tutorial works through comparison at three levels of resolution:\n\n1. **Network-level properties** --- are the two networks structurally different? One might be denser, more centralized, or more reciprocal, and these whole-network differences would be invisible if you only compared individual edges.\n2. **Edge-level differences** --- which specific transitions changed and by how much? This includes the raw difference matrix, 16 per-edge metrics, summary statistics that condense overall divergence into reportable numbers, and visualizations (heatmaps, scatterplots, density plots).\n3. **Centrality** --- did states change roles? A state that acts as a bridge in one group may be peripheral in the other, and centrality differences reveal these structural role shifts.\n\nThe `compare()` function returns seven components that map onto these levels:\n\n| Component | What It Contains |\n|---|---|\n| `$network_metrics` | 13 network-level structural properties |\n| `$difference_matrix` | Element-wise difference ($x - y$) |\n| `$edge_metrics` | 16 edge-level comparison metrics |\n| `$summary_metrics` | 22 aggregate divergence metrics across 5 categories |\n| `$matrices` | The (optionally scaled) input matrices |\n| `$centrality_differences` | Per-node centrality differences across 9 measures |\n| `$centrality_correlations` | Cross-model centrality rank correlations |\n\n**Companion tutorials:**\n\n- [TNA Main Tutorial](../tna-tutorial/index.html) --- building and analyzing a single TNA model\n- [TNA Group Analysis](../tna-group/index.html) --- group comparisons, permutation testing, and bootstrapping\n- [TNA Clustering](../tna-clustering/index.html) --- data-driven clustering of sequences\n- [Preparing Data for TNA](../tna-data/index.html) --- data import and preparation\n\n## Installation\n\nThe `tna` package is the only package required. Install from CRAN:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tna\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nOr install the development version from GitHub:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"sonsoleslp/tna\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Setup: Building Two Models to Compare\n\nWe use the built-in `group_regulation_long` dataset and build group-level TNA models for High and Low achievers. This gives us two models with different transition structures.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the built-in collaborative regulation dataset\ndata(\"group_regulation_long\")\n\n# Convert to sequences, preserving the Achiever metadata column\nprepared_data <- prepare_data(\n  group_regulation_long,\n  action = \"Action\",\n  actor = \"Actor\",\n  time = \"Time\"\n)\n\n# Build separate TNA models for High and Low achievers\ngtna <- group_tna(prepared_data, group = \"Achiever\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe simplest way to call `compare()` is to pass the group TNA object directly. If the object has more than two groups, it picks the first two by default. You can also specify which groups to compare with `i` and `j` (by name or index):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Pass the group object directly; compares the first two groups\ncomp <- compare(gtna)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Selecting Specific Groups or Comparing Individual Models\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Pick specific groups by name or index\ncomp <- compare(gtna, i = \"High\", j = \"Low\")\n\n# Compare two individual tna models directly\ncomp <- compare(gtna$High, gtna$Low)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n# Network Plots\n\nPlotting the two networks side by side is the fastest way to get a sense of whether they look similar or different --- before committing to any specific metric. Look for which transitions are strongest, which states are most active, and whether the two networks share the same dominant pathways. The `minimum` argument hides edges below a threshold, and `cut` fades edges below a second threshold, so the dominant structure stands out.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Side-by-side network plots\nplot(gtna, minimum = 0.05, cut = 0.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Transition networks for High and Low achievers](index_files/figure-html/fig-group-networks-1.png){#fig-group-networks-1 width=3600}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Transition networks for High and Low achievers](index_files/figure-html/fig-group-networks-2.png){#fig-group-networks-2 width=3600}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Difference Network\n\nSide-by-side plots make it hard to compare specific edges because the eye has to jump between two layouts. `plot_compare()` solves this by overlaying both networks on the same node positions, coloring each edge by which group uses it more. This makes it immediately clear which behavioral pathways distinguish the groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Overlay both networks; edge color shows direction of difference\nplot_compare(gtna$High, gtna$Low, minimum = 0.01)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Network overlay: edges colored by direction of difference](index_files/figure-html/fig-plot-compare-1.png){#fig-plot-compare width=4800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Network Metrics {#sec-network-metrics}\n\nBefore looking at individual edges, it is worth checking whether the two networks differ in overall structure. Two models can share similar average edge weights yet differ in how connections are distributed --- one may route behavior through a few hub states (high centralization) while the other spreads transitions more evenly (high density, low centralization). `$network_metrics` reports 13 structural properties for each model, side by side, so you can spot these architectural differences early.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 13 network-level properties, one value per model\ncomp$network_metrics\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"metric\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"x\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"y\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Node Count\",\"2\":\"9.000000000000000000\",\"3\":\"9.000000000000000000\"},{\"1\":\"Edge Count\",\"2\":\"76.000000000000000000\",\"3\":\"75.000000000000000000\"},{\"1\":\"Network Density\",\"2\":\"1.000000000000000000\",\"3\":\"1.000000000000000000\"},{\"1\":\"Mean Distance\",\"2\":\"0.042286768413417199\",\"3\":\"0.055955972261037705\"},{\"1\":\"Mean Out-Strength\",\"2\":\"1.000000000000000000\",\"3\":\"1.000000000000000000\"},{\"1\":\"SD Out-Strength\",\"2\":\"0.914147522772659760\",\"3\":\"0.718567232202511397\"},{\"1\":\"Mean In-Strength\",\"2\":\"1.000000000000000000\",\"3\":\"1.000000000000000000\"},{\"1\":\"SD In-Strength\",\"2\":\"0.000000000000000079\",\"3\":\"0.000000000000000039\"},{\"1\":\"Mean Out-Degree\",\"2\":\"8.444444444444444642\",\"3\":\"8.333333333333333925\"},{\"1\":\"SD Out-Degree\",\"2\":\"1.130388330520877949\",\"3\":\"0.866025403784438708\"},{\"1\":\"Centralization (Out-Degree)\",\"2\":\"0.046875000000000000\",\"3\":\"0.062500000000000000\"},{\"1\":\"Centralization (In-Degree)\",\"2\":\"0.046875000000000000\",\"3\":\"0.062500000000000000\"},{\"1\":\"Reciprocity\",\"2\":\"0.956521739130434812\",\"3\":\"0.941176470588235281\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n| Metric | What It Tells You |\n|---|---|\n| **Node Count** | Whether both models have the same state space |\n| **Edge Count** | Network complexity; more edges = more interconnected |\n| **Network Density** | Proportion of possible edges that exist |\n| **Mean Distance** | Average shortest path length between states |\n| **Mean/SD Out-Strength** | Average and variability of outgoing transition weight per node |\n| **Mean/SD In-Strength** | Average and variability of incoming transition weight per node |\n| **Mean/SD Out-Degree** | Average and variability of outgoing connections per node |\n| **Centralization (Out/In-Degree)** | Whether connections are dominated by a few hub nodes (higher = more hub-like) |\n| **Reciprocity** | Proportion of mutual (bidirectional) edges |\n\nIf two models differ on these properties, it tells you the groups have fundamentally different behavioral architectures --- not just different strengths on the same pathways.\n\n# Edge-Level Comparisons\n\nNetwork metrics tell you *whether* the two networks differ structurally, but not *where*. If density or centralization differs, you need to know which specific transitions drive that difference. The `compare()` output includes three edge-level components for this: a difference matrix, a table of 16 per-edge metrics, and 22 summary metrics that aggregate across all edges.\n\n## The Difference Matrix\n\nThe `$difference_matrix` is the starting point for edge-level comparison --- it shows exactly which transitions are stronger in which group. The matrix is the element-wise subtraction ($x_{ij} - y_{ij}$), so positive values are transitions stronger in the first model and negative values are transitions stronger in the second. For example, if high achievers transition from Planning to Monitoring more often while low achievers cycle within Monitoring, those cells will have opposite signs. Rows are source states, columns are target states.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Element-wise: High minus Low (positive = stronger in High)\ncomp$difference_matrix\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n              adapt cohesion consensus coregulate discuss emotion  monitor\nadapt       0.00000 -0.01476   0.05577     -0.030  -0.032  0.0304 -0.00696\ncohesion    0.00533  0.03711   0.08578     -0.085  -0.043  0.0061 -0.03578\nconsensus  -0.00132  0.01056   0.00308     -0.036   0.096  0.0187 -0.02421\ncoregulate  0.01122 -0.00045  -0.04763     -0.018  -0.071  0.0577  0.01813\ndiscuss    -0.09616  0.02905   0.21028     -0.024  -0.052  0.0133 -0.01176\nemotion     0.00167  0.00102   0.03465     -0.024   0.044 -0.0314 -0.01035\nmonitor    -0.00019 -0.01228   0.00081     -0.013  -0.010  0.0101  0.00146\nplan        0.00077  0.01186   0.00662      0.013  -0.015  0.0668  0.00038\nsynthesis  -0.15825 -0.00866   0.19051     -0.052  -0.059 -0.0101 -0.02139\n              plan synthesis\nadapt      -0.0021   0.00000\ncohesion    0.0232   0.00640\nconsensus  -0.0677   0.00081\ncoregulate  0.0497   0.00043\ndiscuss     0.0017  -0.07025\nemotion    -0.0208   0.00516\nmonitor     0.0184   0.00521\nplan       -0.0875   0.00315\nsynthesis   0.1198   0.00000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Difference Heatmap\n\nWith many states, scanning a numeric matrix for patterns is slow. The heatmap makes structure visible: clusters of same-colored cells in a row mean one group has systematically stronger outgoing transitions from that state, which indicates the state plays a different role for each group. Isolated intense cells point to specific transitions that distinguish the groups.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Difference heatmap\nplot(comp, type = \"heatmap\", population = \"difference\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Difference heatmap: blue = stronger in High, red = stronger in Low](index_files/figure-html/fig-heatmap-diff-1.png){#fig-heatmap-diff width=4800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Scatterplot\n\nThe heatmap and difference matrix show *which* edges differ, but not whether the two models agree on the overall pattern of transition weights. The scatterplot answers that: each point is one edge, plotted by its weight in both models, and the correlation coefficient printed on the plot quantifies overall linear agreement. A Pearson $r$ above 0.9 indicates that both models prioritize the same transitions --- they share the same structure at different intensities. A low $r$ means the models disagree about which transitions matter. Points far from the diagonal are the specific edges driving any disagreement; these are candidates for closer inspection in the edge metrics table.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Each point is one edge; diagonal = identical weights\nplot(comp, type = \"scatterplot\", method = \"pearson\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Edge weight scatterplot with Pearson correlation](index_files/figure-html/fig-scatter-pearson-1.png){#fig-scatter-pearson width=4200}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Scatterplot with Other Correlation Methods\n\nThe `method` argument can also be `\"spearman\"` (rank-based, robust to outliers), `\"kendall\"` (concordance-based), or `\"distance\"` (detects nonlinear relationships).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Rank-based correlation, robust to outliers\nplot(comp, type = \"scatterplot\", method = \"spearman\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Edge weight scatterplot with Spearman rank correlation](index_files/figure-html/fig-scatter-spearman-1.png){#fig-scatter-spearman width=3600}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Weight Density\n\nThe difference matrix and scatterplot compare individual edges, but two models can have similar edge-by-edge profiles yet distribute their total probability very differently. The density plot reveals this: if one group concentrates its weight on a few dominant transitions (peaked, long-tailed distribution) while the other spreads weight more evenly (flatter distribution), the groups differ in behavioral diversity even when their strongest edges agree. This connects directly to the CV Ratio in the summary metrics --- a ratio far from 1.0 means unequal dispersion, and the density plot shows where that dispersion difference comes from.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Overlay of weight distributions\nplot(comp, type = \"weight_density\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of edge weights in both models](index_files/figure-html/fig-weight-density-1.png){#fig-weight-density width=3600}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Summary of All Plot Options\n\n| `type` | `population` options | `method` options | What It Shows |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `\"heatmap\"` | `\"difference\"`, `\"x\"`, `\"y\"` | --- | Edge weight matrices as color grids |\n| `\"scatterplot\"` | --- | `\"pearson\"`, `\"spearman\"`, `\"kendall\"`, `\"distance\"` | Edge weights plotted against each other |\n| `\"centrality_heatmap\"` | --- | --- | Centrality differences by state and measure |\n| `\"weight_density\"` | --- | --- | Overlaid weight distributions |\n\nAll plot types accept `name_x` and `name_y` to label the two models in the plot.\n:::\n\n## Edge Metrics Table\n\nA raw difference of 0.05 between edges weighted 0.06 and 0.01 is a very different situation from the same 0.05 between edges weighted 0.50 and 0.45 --- the first is a fivefold change, the second is a 10% shift. The `$edge_metrics` table ($n^2$ rows, 16 columns) provides multiple ways to quantify each edge's difference so you can distinguish these cases. Sorting by `absolute_difference` identifies the transitions with the largest raw gaps; sorting by `relative_difference` or `similarity_strength_index` surfaces proportionally large changes that raw magnitude would miss. Here are the edges with the largest absolute differences:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Edges sorted by largest absolute difference\nedge_sorted <-

Definitions\n\n**`raw_difference`**: $w^x_{ij} - w^y_{ij}$ --- the signed difference. Positive = stronger in model $x$.\n\n**`absolute_difference`**: $|w^x_{ij} - w^y_{ij}|$ --- unsigned magnitude of difference.\n\n**`squared_difference`**: $(w^x_{ij} - w^y_{ij})^2$ --- penalizes large differences disproportionately.\n\n**`relative_difference`**: $\\frac{|w^x_{ij} - w^y_{ij}|}{w^x_{ij} + w^y_{ij}}$ --- normalized by combined magnitude. Range: $[0, 1]$. A difference of 0.01 between edges of weight 0.02 and 0.01 (relative = 0.33) is more meaningful than the same 0.01 between 0.50 and 0.49 (relative = 0.01).\n\n**`similarity_strength_index`**: $\\frac{w^x_{ij}}{w^y_{ij}}$ --- multiplicative ratio. Value of 2.0 = edge is twice as strong in model $x$.\n\n**`difference_index`**: $\\frac{w^x_{ij} - w^y_{ij}}{w^y_{ij}}$ --- percentage change from model $y$.\n\n**`rank_difference`**: $|\\text{rank}(w^x_{ij}) - \\text{rank}(w^y_{ij})|$ --- ordinal comparison regardless of absolute values.\n\n**`percentile_difference`**: $|F_x(w^x_{ij}) - F_y(w^y_{ij})|$ --- ECDF-based. Range: $[0, 1]$.\n\n**`logarithmic_ratio`**: $\\log(1+w^x_{ij}) - \\log(1+w^y_{ij})$ --- proportional comparison that handles zeros.\n\n**`standardized_weight_x` / `standardized_weight_y`**: Z-scores within each model: $z^x_{ij} = (w^x_{ij} - \\bar{w}^x) / \\sigma_{w^x}$.\n\n**`standardized_score_inflation`**: $z^x_{ij} / z^y_{ij}$ --- ratio of standardized weights.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n## NaN and Inf Values in Edge Metrics\n\nSeveral metrics involve division and produce `NaN` or `Inf` when denominators are zero:\n\n- **`similarity_strength_index`** and **`difference_index`**: `Inf` when $w^y = 0$\n- **`standardized_score_inflation`**: `Inf` or `NaN` when $z^y = 0$\n- **`relative_difference`**: `NaN` when both weights are zero\n\nThese occur for edges that exist in only one model. Filter before aggregation (e.g., `dplyr::filter(is.finite(similarity_strength_index))`).\n:::\n\n## Summary Metrics {#sec-summary-metrics}\n\nEdge-level metrics tell you about specific transitions, but a paper or presentation often needs a single number: \"how different are these two networks?\" The `$summary_metrics` table condenses all edge-level differences into 22 aggregate measures across 5 categories.

A state that acts as a bridge (high betweenness) in one group may be peripheral in the other --- meaning the groups route their behavior through different hubs. A state that gains outstrength has become a more dominant launching point. `compare()` provides three centrality-related outputs: a table of per-node differences, a heatmap visualization, and cross-model correlations.\n\n## Centrality Differences\n\nTo identify *which* states changed roles and *how*, check `$centrality_differences`. Each row is one state--measure combination, with columns for each model's value and their difference. A positive difference means the state has higher centrality in the first model; negative means higher in the second.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Centrality values and differences: 9

Use `\"log1p\"` instead if your matrix contains zeros.\n- Scaling changes the *magnitude* of all downstream metrics. Summary metrics from scaled matrices are not directly comparable to those from unscaled matrices.\n:::\n\n# From Comparison to Significance {#sec-significance}\n\n`compare()` tells you *how much* two models differ, but not whether those differences are statistically significant. A difference of 0.05 in a transition probability could be real or could be sampling noise. The `permutation_test()` function tests this by randomly reassigning group labels thousands of times to build a null distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(265)\n# Permutation
