  abstract  = "Despite the growing concerns surrounding algorithmic biases in
               generative AI (artificial intelligence), there is a noticeable
               lack of research on how to facilitate children and young people’s
               awareness and understanding of them. This study aimed to address
               this gap by conducting hands-on workshops with fourth- and
               seventh-grade students in Finland, and by focusing on students’ (
               N = 209) evolving explanations of the potential causes of
               algorithmic biases within text-to-image generative models.
               Statistically significant progress in children’s data-driven
               explanations was observed on a written reasoning test, which was
               administered prior to and after the intervention, as well as in
               their responses to the worksheets they filled out during a lesson
               that focused on algorithmic biases. The article concludes with a
               discussion on the development and facilitation of children’s
               understanding of algorithmic biases.",

  abstract = "Engagement can be understood as a complex dynamic system that
              unfolds over time and interacts within the student, school, and
              environment. Most of the research on the dynamics of engagement
              comes from classroom settings and it is so far inconclusive how
              and why engagement and disengagement evolve over time. Using
              person-centered methods, sequence, transition, and covariate
              analysis, we examined a large dataset of 18 consecutive courses of
              245 students over a full program. We identified three engagement
              states (active, average, and disengaged), as well as three
              distinct longitudinal engagement trajectories (engaged,
              fluctuating, and mostly disengaged). Taken together, our results
              showed that engagement trajectories are rather stable over time
              conforming to the universal dynamics of complex systems. Engaged
              students were driven by course materials, their achievement, and
              their previous engaged states (momentum). Most importantly, our
              results offer a novel theoretical grounding for the understanding
              of disengagement which has so far remained unexplained. According
              to our results, disengagement follows the dynamics of a complex
              system where stability does not require a hard-wired causal
              mechanism but rather, it is an attractor state that pulls the
              system to settle in (inertia). Thus, disengagement becomes a hard
              to change equilibrium state for those students (or a stuck state).",

                   human-like responses and behaviors, creating new
                   opportunities for psychological science. In the context of
                   self-regulated learning (SRL), if LLMs can reliably simulate
                   survey responses at scale and speed, they could be used to
                   test intervention scenarios, refine theoretical models,
                   augment sparse datasets, and represent hard-to-reach
                   populations. However, the validity of LLM-generated survey
                   responses remains uncertain, with limited research focused on
                   SRL and existing studies beyond SRL yielding mixed results.
                   Therefore, in this study, we examined LLM-generated responses
                   to the 44-item Motivated Strategies for Learning
                   Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich \& De Groot, 1990), a widely
                   used instrument assessing students' learning strategies and
                   academic motivation. Particularly, we used the LLMs GPT-4o,
                   Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2 Flash, LLaMA 3.1-8B, and Mistral
                   Large. We analyzed item distributions, the psychological
                   network of the theoretical SRL dimensions, and psychometric
                   validity based on the latent factor structure. Our results
                   suggest that Gemini 2 Flash was the most promising LLM,
                   showing considerable sampling variability and producing
                   underlying dimensions and theoretical relationships that
                   align with prior theory and empirical findings. At the same
                   time, we observed discrepancies and limitations, underscoring
                   both the potential and current constraints of using LLMs for
                   simulating psychological survey data and applying it in

  abstract = "Research has repeatedly demonstrated that students with effective
              learning strategies are more likely to have better academic
              achievement. Existing research has mostly focused on a single
              course or two, while longitudinal studies remain scarce. The
              present study examines the longitudinal sequence of students'
              strategies, their succession, consistency, temporal unfolding, and
              whether students tend to retain or adapt strategies between
              courses. We use a large dataset of online traces from 135 students
              who completed 10 successive courses (i.e., 1350 course
              enrollments) in a higher education program. The methods used in
              this study have shown the feasibility of using trace data recorded
              by learning management systems to unobtrusively trace and model
              the longitudinal learning strategies across a program. We
              identified three program-level strategy trajectories: a stable and
              intense trajectory related to deep learning where students used
              diverse strategies and scored the highest grades; a fluctuating
              interactive trajectory, where students focused on course
              requirements, scored average grades, and were relatively
              fluctuating; and a light trajectory related to surface learning
              where students invested the least effort, scored the lowest
              grades, and had a relatively stable pathway. Students who were
              intensely active were more likely to transfer the intense
              strategies and therefore, they were expected to require less
              support or guidance. Students focusing on course requirements were
              not as effective self-regulators as they seemed and possibly
              required early guidance and support from teachers. Students with
              consistent light strategies or low effort needed proactive
              guidance and support.",
