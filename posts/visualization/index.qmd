Data visualization is definitely my favorite part of research. I am not a designer and have not received formal training in data visualization, but it's something I deeply enjoy and it is one of the tasks that I do when I want to feel productive but I don't feel like writing or responding to emails.

The images I’ve collected in this post are some of my favorites from different papers. Some are meant to explain a complicated finding. Others try to capture a messy idea or illustrate the full analytical pipeline.



The first figure is a classic in my research, which is using sequence analysis to illustrate longitudinal trajectories of categorical variables. This one specifically is from a recent paper in *Computers in Human Behaviour* [@Lopez-Pernas2024-bv]. I use the `TraMineR` package for this. For the transitions, I use `tna`, our own package for Transition Network Analysis, based on `qgraph`. I love this figure not only because I think it is very aesthetically pleasing but because it allows you to see the whole picture immediately. I have used many of such figures in my research using the VaSStra method, to which I devoted [another post](../vasstra).

Another type of figure that my colleagues really like is the alluvial plot. I have shared a tutorial on how to create it with `ggalluvial` in a [previous post](../alluvial). The example below is meant to illustrate transitions between (categorical) answers to a pre-test and post-test about AI in social media [@Vartiainen2024-vf].

One of my latest favorites is this image from our recent study on LLM-generated responses to the MSLQ questionnaire [@Vogelsmeier2025-hi]. For this one, I used my go-to package `ggplot2`. The code will be available once the article is published. The figure represents the factor loadings from Exploratory Factor Anaysis, with columns representing extracted factors (f1 – f7 on the x-axis) and rows grouped by theoretical constructs of MSLQ.

Lastly, I often create figures that summarize the analytical pipeline in my papers, so readers can understand the methods used easily. I don't use any fancy tools, just Google Slides and a lot of patience.

For example, the following figure illustrates three levels of sequence analysis clustering, following VaSSTra, part of one of my early papers in learning analytics [@Saqr2023-ts].

For my recent [book](https://lamethods.org), I also created many of these figures. For example, for the chapter on eXplainable AI using LLMs [@Lopez-Pernas2025-dw].
